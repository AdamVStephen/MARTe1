Build Issues and Resolutions

Some historical notes that may be of benefit for problems in other contexts, or on new platforms.

11 GAMs fail to build on first attempt.

GAMs that did not compile cleanly:

1. DataCollectionGAM                                  
1.1 Repeat manual build in local directory succeeeds
1. DelayGAM                                        
1.1 Repeat manual build in local directory succeeeds
1. DigitalFilterGAM                                     
1.1 Erroneous error : library already built.
1. ExpEval                                              
1.1 Erroneous error : library already built.
1. PIDGAM                                            
1.1 Repeat manual build in local directory succeeeds
1. PlottingGAM                                                                          
1.1 Erroneous error : library already built.
1. StatisticGAM                                      
1.1 Erroneous error : library already built.
1. StorageGAM                              
1.1 Erroneous error : library already built.
1.1 WaterTank         
1.1 Erroneous error : library already built.
1. WaveformGenerator2009
1.1 No linux/ directory because depends target fails due to dependency on non-existence ExpressionEvaluator2009 in WaveformEquationSolver
1.2 Makefile.inc has commented out WaveformEquationSolver module but the depends rules still find matching on pattern.
1.3 Solution : rename the code to be suffixed .disabled
1.4 Solution : make the top level depends rules work to create the linux/ subdirectory first (ewhittaker fork)
1. WebStatisticGAM          
1.1 Erroneous error : library already built.

Now investigate the common errors where a second build works.
